"""Local session state for a thrds session — the write-through cache of thread ownership.

Written to ``thrds.yml`` at the session root, tracked and gist-mirrored via
the git repo so multi-machine sees the same authoritative slug → thread_ts map
without needing to scan Slack. The Slack ``metadata`` field on each posted message
carries the same info (session_id, slug, kind) as belt-and-suspenders: if the
local state is lost or corrupted, ``thrds slack recover`` scans Slack filtered by
session_id and rebuilds this file.

Per-thread model (``specs/per-thread-model.md``)
------------------------------------------------
::

    private ephemeral channel (PEC)  ↔  gist  ↔  session  ↔  N threads
                                                  thread  ↔  one `NN-slug.md`

``threads`` maps each thread's slug to a :class:`ThreadEntry`: where its draft
lives in the staging channel, where it's destined (:class:`ThreadTarget`), and
its lifecycle state. **Destination is a property of the thread, not the
session** — that's what collapses the two use cases into one shape:

- batch: N threads, all targeting one channel with no ``thread_ts`` (the
  session-level ``prod_channel`` supplies it as a default, so no per-thread
  config is needed at all);
- reply: N threads, each targeting a different channel and/or an existing
  thread within it.

Legacy layout (pre-per-thread)
------------------------------
Sessions created before the per-thread model have a single ``doc_path`` holding
many ``===``-separated threads, with pointers split across ``staging_threads``
and ``prod_threads[channel][slug]``, and ``prod_channel`` as the *authority*
for prod pushes rather than a default. :attr:`SessionState.is_legacy` detects
these; ``thrds slack migrate`` converts one. The legacy fields are retained
(and still drive the pre-migration code paths) until every live session has
been migrated.

``platform`` identifies which subcommand group owns this session:

- ``"slack"``: the default; ``thrds slack …`` verbs operate on it.
- ``"discord"`` / ``"bsky"``: reserved for future subcommand groups.
- ``"capture"``: no platform target — gist-mirrored trajectory only, `thrds capture …`.

Old state files (pre-0.6) predate the field and default to ``"slack"`` on load.
