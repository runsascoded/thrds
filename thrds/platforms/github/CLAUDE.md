# ghpr Development Guide

This document provides context for Claude Code when continuing development on `ghpr`.

## Project Overview

`ghpr` (GitHub PR) is a CLI tool for managing GitHub PRs and Issues locally with bidirectional sync and gist mirroring.

**PyPI Package**: `ghpr-py` (published)
**Repository**: https://github.com/runsascoded/ghpr
**Command**: `ghpr`

## Core Workflow

```
GitHub Issue/PR ↔ Local Clone → Gist (read replica/mirror)
```

The gist is a **read replica** of the local clone. `push`/`pull` operations sync between local and GitHub, and the gist is automatically updated to mirror local state.

### Sync contract (both directions read committed state)

`refs/remotes/github` (see `refs.py`) tracks GitHub's state inside each clone's nested repo — the analog of `origin/main`. Without it there's no merge base, and `pull` can only overwrite. It lives under `refs/remotes/` because that's one of the namespaces git auto-enables reflogs for; outside them the ref kept no record of its own movements. The name is the remote's name and nothing else, with git's branch component elided (there's one state per item); legacy `refs/remotes/github/remote` and `refs/ghpr/remote` migrate automatically on read.

- **`fetch`** (`commands/fetch.py`) materializes GitHub's state as a commit and advances the ref. It builds that commit in a throwaway worktree under the git dir, so the user's working tree, index, and branch are never touched — which is also what makes `-n` genuinely side-effect-free. Review baselines land in the scratch worktree's per-worktree git dir and are only promoted when the fetch is kept.
- **`pull`** = `fetch` + reconcile (`rebase` default, `merge`/`overwrite` via `-m` or `git config ghpr.pullMode`) + gist mirror. It refuses to rebase/merge over uncommitted changes instead of overwriting them, and — like git's `pull` — never writes to GitHub. It reconciles off *the ref's position* (`merge-base --is-ancestor`), not off "did this fetch see anything new": a `push` gate refusal advances the ref without moving HEAD, so those are different questions.
- **`sync`** (`commands/sync.py`) = `pull` then `push`, the round trip `pull` used to do implicitly. It passes `no_gate=True`, since its own `pull` just answered what the gate would ask.
- **`push`** sends HEAD, never the working tree (Contract A). `_gate_upstream` fetches first and refuses unless the ref is an ancestor of HEAD — git's non-fast-forward rule, stated deliberately as "does HEAD contain the remote state" rather than "did GitHub move since the last fetch" (the latter self-clears the moment the refusal records the fetch, so the retry sails through and does the damage the first push refused) (`-G`/`--no-gate` overrides; bootstrap pushes are ungated, since with no recorded base there is nothing to compare and `push` *is* the "local wins" answer). A refusal still advances the ref — the fetch is an observation, and recording it is what makes the follow-up `git diff HEAD refs/remotes/github` show the change that caused it. It advances the ref to HEAD only when the sync was complete; if anything was held back (dirty files, others' comments, `--no-comments`) the base stays put, so the next `pull` still replays local work rather than silently dropping it.
- `clone` sets the ref once everything is committed. Legacy clones have no recorded base: `resolve_base()` proposes HEAD, and `bootstrap_is_ambiguous()` adopts it only if the fetch confirms HEAD == GitHub. If they differ, neither side can be shown to be ahead and both guesses lose data, so it refuses with the ref left unset — `-m overwrite` and `push` are the explicit answers.

## Current State

### Completed
- ✅ Basic clone/push/pull/diff commands
- ✅ `refs/remotes/github` merge base + `ghpr fetch`; `pull` rebases (or merges) instead of clobbering local commits
- ✅ `pull` no longer writes to GitHub (`ghpr sync` = pull + push); `push` gates on a stale upstream (`-G` overrides)
- ✅ Comment support (fetch, diff, push comments)
- ✅ Review-thread sync (inline PR comments): clone/pull threads to flat `gh/<num>/z-<head_id>-<NN>-<author>.md` files (head frontmatter holds thread metadata), edit/reply/resolve locally, push back (REST + GraphQL); `ghpr review reply|resolve|unresolve`
- ✅ Gist mirroring
- ✅ Issue and PR support
- ✅ Comments default enabled (with `--no-comments` opt-out)
- ✅ Directory structure: `gh/{num}/` for both PRs and issues
- ✅ Comment filename format: `z{id}-{author}.md`
- ✅ Draft comment workflow: `new*.md` → post → rename
- ✅ Unified diff display between `diff` and `push -n`
- ✅ Image upload command using `utz.git.gist`
- ✅ Shell completion (Click-powered, subcommands + flags/options on bare `<tab>`)
- ✅ Shell integration with aliases (`ghprc`, `ghprd`, `ghprp`, `ghia`, etc.)
- ✅ Parallel drafts: `ghpr init <slug>` → `gh/drafts/<slug>/`
- ✅ `ghpr clone` auto-detects current branch's PR when no spec given
- ✅ `ghpr create` auto-inits nested git repo (works when parent has `gh/` gitignored)
- ✅ PyPI package `ghpr-py` published
- ✅ Repository created with filtered history
- ✅ Modular package structure (commands in separate modules)
- ✅ Using published `utz>=0.21.3` for git utilities

### Recent Changes

**Ref namespace + honest bootstrap** (latest; from `specs/converge-fetch-refs-ux.md`, written by the thrds session after it built the same design):
- `refs/ghpr/remote` → `refs/remotes/github`, so git auto-enables a reflog for it (verified: 0 vs 2 reflog entries); also gets `git branch -r` listing and bare `github` shorthand. Legacy names migrate on read. No `[remote "github"]` config section — a URL-less remote would break `git fetch --all`.
- Bootstrap no longer guesses. `ensure_remote_ref` (which set the base to HEAD with a warning) is gone; `resolve_base()` + `bootstrap_is_ambiguous()` adopt HEAD only when the fetch confirms it matches GitHub, and otherwise refuse. Guessing "GitHub is ahead" reverted unpushed local work and pushed the reversion — the original bug, on the one path where the base was a guess; guessing "local is ahead" would push a stale HEAD over a newer remote.
- Still open from that spec: three-way classification in `ghpr diff` (§2) and a `push` upstream gate (§3).

**`refs/ghpr/remote` + `ghpr fetch`; `pull` reconciles instead of clobbering**:
- `refs.py`: `read_remote_ref` / `set_remote_ref` over the ref
- `commands/fetch.py`: `build_snapshot()` builds GitHub's state as a commit in a scratch worktree at `<git-common-dir>/ghpr/fetch-wt`, so nothing user-visible is touched; `resolve_item()` factors out owner/repo/number/type resolution shared with `pull`
- `commands/pull.py`: rewritten as fetch + `_reconcile()` (rebase/merge/overwrite) + push; aborts on a dirty WT in rebase/merge modes; `-n` is a pure read
- Fixed: `pull` used to overwrite local files with remote content and commit that, reverting unpushed local commits and then pushing the reversion; `pull -n` used to write + stage the description
- `reviews.pull()` lost its `dry_run` param — the scratch worktree subsumes it

**Auto-init nested git repo on `ghpr create`**:
- `_ensure_nested_git_repo()` in `commands/create.py` runs `git init` at the draft dir if it's not already its own git toplevel
- Lets `ghpr create` work even when the parent project has `gh/` in `.gitignore` (the typical setup)
- `git rm DESCRIPTION.md` now uses `-q --ignore-unmatch` so it handles both tracked (existing `ghpr init` repo) and untracked (fresh nested repo) cases

**Parallel drafts under `gh/drafts/<slug>/`**:
- `ghpr init <slug>` and `ghpr create <slug>` resolve to `gh/drafts/<slug>/` (was `gh/new-<slug>/` briefly in v0.1.9)
- Keeps drafts visually separated from filed `gh/<number>/` dirs
- `ghpr init` (no arg) still creates `gh/new/` for back-compat
- Finalize logic walks up to find the `gh/` ancestor, so all layouts rename to `gh/<number>/` on filing

**`ghpr clone` auto-detects branch's PR**:
- `ghprc` (no args) uses `gh pr view` to find the open PR for the current branch and clone it

**Shell Completion**:
- Click-powered tab completion for subcommands, flags, and options
- Patched `Command.shell_complete` and `Argument.shell_complete` in `cli.py` to suggest options on bare `<tab>` (Click only does this when user types `-`)
- Completion script generated inline by `shell_integration.py` (avoids extra Python invocation)
- Click's Bash version warning suppressed (macOS system bash 3.2 triggers it)
- `ghia` alias added for `ghpr ingest-attachments`

**Comment Ownership Warnings**:
- `ghpr diff` and `ghpr push -n` warn when showing diffs for comments authored by others
- `ghpr push` skips others' comments by default, with clear summary message
- Use `-C` (`--force-others`) to attempt pushing edits to others' comments

**Trailing Newline Handling**:
- `write_description_with_link_ref` ensures files always end with a newline
- Fixes diff thrashing when GitHub strips trailing newlines from PR descriptions
- `render_unified_diff` only shows "No newline" indicator when sides actually differ

**Draft Comment Workflow**:
- Create files starting with `new` and ending in `.md` (e.g., `new.md`, `new-feature.md`)
- Commit them to git
- `ghpr push` automatically:
  1. Posts them as comments to GitHub
  2. Creates a commit renaming `new*.md` → `z{comment_id}-{author}.md`
  3. Syncs to gist

**Image Upload**:
- `ghpr upload <file>` uploads to gist and returns markdown URLs
- Uses `utz.git.gist` module for shared functionality
- Auto-formats as markdown for images, URL for other files

## Key Design Principles

1. **Gist as read replica**: Gist always mirrors local state, never the source of truth
2. **Comments by default**: Comment operations are core functionality, not optional
3. **Fail fast**: Better to error on ambiguity than guess wrong
4. **Git as storage**: Use git commits for versioning, leverage existing git workflows
5. **Prefer existing tools**: Use `gh` CLI for API operations, `git` for VCS

## Code Patterns

### Error Handling
```python
if not all([owner, repo, number]):
    err("Error: Could not determine PR/Issue from directory")
    exit(1)
```

### Git Config Storage
```python
proc.run('git', 'config', 'pr.owner', owner, log=None)
item_type = proc.line('git', 'config', 'pr.type', err_ok=True, log=None)
```

### Comment File Format
```markdown
<!-- author: ryan-williams -->
<!-- created_at: 2025-10-15T04:38:13Z -->
<!-- updated_at: 2025-10-15T04:38:13Z -->

Comment body here...
```

### API Patterns
```python
# Fetch comments
comments = proc.json('gh', 'api', f'repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues/{number}/comments', log=False)

# Post comment (use -F with body=@file to read from file)
result = proc.json(
    'gh', 'api',
    '-X', 'POST',
    f'repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues/{number}/comments',
    '-F', f'body=@{temp_file}',
    log=False
)
```

## Testing

Test with the example issue:
```bash
cd ~/c/oa/marin/issue1773  # Existing test case
# Or clone fresh:
ghpr clone https://github.com/marin-community/marin/issues/1773
```

## Related Files

- `utz` library: Used for `proc` (subprocess), `err` (stderr output), `cd` (context manager), and git utilities

## Dependencies

```toml
dependencies = [
    "click>=8.0",    # CLI framework
    "utz>=0.21.3",   # Subprocess and git utility helpers
]
```

## Notes

- Original author email: `ryan@runsascoded.com`
- History preserved from `ryan-williams/git-helpers` repo
- The `z` prefix on comment files ensures they sort after the main description
