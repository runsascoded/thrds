"""Sync command - `pull` then `push`: the full round trip, in one verb.

`pull` used to end by pushing, which made it the one place ghpr's git analogy
broke (git's `pull` never writes to the remote) and gave `-n` two meanings at
once. The round trip is still the common workflow, so it keeps a name — just an
honest one, that says a remote write is about to happen.
