"""Convert a legacy single-doc session to the per-thread-file layout.

A legacy session has one ``.md`` holding every thread (``===``-separated), with
thread pointers split across ``staging_threads`` and
``prod_threads[channel][slug]``. The per-thread layout (see
``specs/per-thread-model.md``) has one ``NN-slug.md`` per thread and a single
``threads`` map carrying each thread's staging ts, destination, and state.

Migration is split into a **pure planning** step (:func:`plan_migration`, which
touches no files and is exhaustively testable) and an **apply** step
(:func:`apply_migration`). That split exists because the interesting failure
modes — a thread with no slug, a slug posted to two different prod channels, a
preamble colliding with a real thread's slug — are all detectable from the doc
and state alone, and should abort before anything on disk changes.

Content is preserved byte-for-byte: each thread's messages are re-serialized
through the same ``_split_messages`` / ``_render_frontmatter`` helpers that the
legacy doc parser uses, so a migrated file's body is exactly the bytes that
lived between its ``===`` header and the next one.
