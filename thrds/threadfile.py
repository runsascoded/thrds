"""Thread files: ``NN-slug.md``, one per Slack thread in a session.

The session directory holds one markdown file per thread, named with a
two-digit ordering prefix and the thread's slug::

    01-cw-quickwins.md
    02-cw-summary.md
    03-cw-mpu.md

Rationale (see ``specs/per-thread-model.md``): with N threads in one doc, the
gist's git history interleaves unrelated drafts, so a commit reads as "the doc
changed" rather than "*this message* went v2→v3". Since the gist history is the
artifact these sessions are collected for, that conflation is the costly part.
One file per thread makes per-file history exactly that message's revision
trajectory.

The ``NN`` prefix gives deterministic ordering for the batch case (post six
messages in a known order) and costs nothing for the reply case. It carries no
identity: the ``slug`` is what keys ``thrds.yml``'s ``threads`` map, is stamped
into each posted message's Slack metadata, and is the target of ``[text](#slug)``
cross-references from sibling threads. So renumbering is cheap — `reorder` (or
editing the name in a staged message's chrome line) moves files and nothing
else, and git reconstructs each thread's history across the rename from content.
